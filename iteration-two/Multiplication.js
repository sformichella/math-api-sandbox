// What is multiplication?
// Guess: whereas addition is like to like,
// multiplication is everything to everything.

// What's everything?
// I think this refers to terms in a sum
// When it's just multiplications, i.e. xyz,
// mult is just like addition

// PROBLEM
// How do we handle symbolic expressions like 'x'?

class Multiplication {
  constructor(operandOne, operandTwo) {
    this.operandOne = operandOne;
    this.operandTwo = operandTwo;
  }
}
